The Isgl3dPODImporter provides an example of how to obtain data from a POWERVR POD
scene data file and convert the data into iSGL3D objects.

Essentially, the Isgl3dPODImporter provides an interface to the POWERVR POD importer tools available from
the Imagination Technologies Limited, POWERVR SDK (http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/powervr-sdk.asp),
of which some of the C++ tools classes are contained here in the pvrtools directory with kind permission 
of Imagination Technologies Limited.

The importer is capable of reproducing from POD data :
 - Simple non-animated meshes
 - Animated (skinned) meshes
 - Bones forming a skeleton
 - Texture and color materials
 - Lights
 - Cameras
