iSGL3D - TODO
=============

Note
----
The following is a list of elements to be modified and ideas for future functionality in iSGL3D.
Modifications to iSGL3D are welcome from motivated members of the community... let me know if you
wish any of your changes to be added to the source repository - iSGL3D is always looking for motivated
team members!
Similarly, if you have ideas for new functionality then don't hesitate to contact me at isgl3d@gmail.com
or via the user group at http://groups.google.com/group/isgl3d


Priority
--------
	

Desirable
---------
  - OpenGL ES 2.0 render problems: generic shader not working since iOS4.2?
    - [update 07/03/11] problems now rests in spotlighting only.  
  - Shaders in ES 2.0:
    - Ambient occlusion
    - Bump mapping
    - User-defined shaders incorporated into materials (kind of Isgl3dFXMaterial)
    - Improve generic vertex shader perf for lighting using #defines for lights enabled?
  - Actions for animations
  - Bezier surfaces
  - Composite materials with blending functions
  - Collada import
  - Inverse kinematics
  - Tweens
    - phase events
    - delay
    - replace by actions?
  - Extended UI features (or integration of cocos2d)
    - [update 07/03/11 Cocos2d difficult to integrate due to different architectures, handling of renderer states, plus only ES 1.1 compatible]
  - Shadows: shadow mapping + antialiasing
     - Fix current shadow mapping
     - Control of shadow map generation with ShadowCastingLight view matrix properties (fov etc)
     - or shadow map generation on cube map
     - or shadow volume
     - use texture floats for depths
  - Try 16 bit textures (http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/prog_guide:best_practices)
  - Better particle system (improve perfs and more user-definable generators)
  - Group multiple mesh VBOs into a single VBO but with different offsets (same VBO Id... how to handle UVs)
  - gl_lines
  - Print order of rendered objects with OpenGL requirements for a scene for debug
