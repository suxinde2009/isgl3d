 - ccBridge
   Allows iSGL3D and Cocos2d to be be combined in a single iOS application. iSGL3D uses the OpenGL frame and
   render buffers created by Cocos2d. The Isgl3dDirector provides the application main loop and an 
   Isgl3dRenderPhaseCallback is added to Isgl3dDirector to listen to the postRender phase at which point 
   drawSceneForIsgl3d needs to be called on the CCDirector+Isgl3d category. An example AppDelegate is included
   to show how to initialise both libraries and use the classes mentioned above.
   Note that the this is experimental. The current version does not support isgl3d shadows.
