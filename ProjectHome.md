# News! #

iSGL3D source code has now moved to github : https://github.com/isgl3d/isgl3d

# About #

iSGL3D is a 3D framework for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad written in Objective-C. The principal behind iSGL3D is to make construction and manipulation of 3D scenes as simple as possible for a developer.

With a single line of code you can add a 3D object whether it is a simple primitive, a sprite (or particle) or your own imported asset. Properties on these objects allow you to modify their appearance, position, rotation and more very simply. You can add containers too to group objects and manipulate them together. In a short period of time you can build up a complex 3D scene.
